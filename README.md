# Introduction

I led a team of four people to build a website that is primarily aimed to help perfume beginners to choose a perfume online. It was built using the React library of JavaScript. Conventional perfume websites suffer from not being able to deliver the ‘feel’ of perfume to a buyer, especially someone who doesn’t know much about perfumes. Perdict tries to address the issue by introducing radar charts (visual) and music (hearing) to better describe the scent of a perfume. I mainly worked with implementing the radar chart API and helped with the overall design. Our website was selected as the most creative among 30 other teams.

# Notes

This website was hosted to https://intizar-t.github.io/perdict/#/ via Github Pages. However, the Google Signin function doesn't yet work on the hosted version. The bugs will be fixed soon! In the meantime, in order to enjoy the signin functionality, please clone this repo, `npm install` the dependencies from package.json and `npm start` the project on your local.

# Screenshots of Google Signin

Here are some screenshots to demonstrate how signing in and personalizing your experience on Perdict looks like. After signing in and choosing your perfumes of interest, this is what you see on your page:
