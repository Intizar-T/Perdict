# Indroduction

I led a team of four people to build a website that is primarily aimed to help perfume beginners to choose a perfume online. It was built using the React library of JavaScript. Conventional perfume websites suffer from not being able to deliver the ‘feel’ of perfume to a buyer, especially someone who doesn’t know much about perfumes. Perdict tries to address the issue by introducing radar charts (visual) and music (hearing) to better describe the scent of a perfume. I mainly worked with implementing the radar chart API and helped with the overall design. Our website was selected as the most creative among 30 other teams.
